/**
 * MCP stdio entry point for the Claude Code plugin.
 *
 * A plugin install is a git clone — nothing runs `npm install`, so on first
 * launch there are no dependencies and no `dist/`. This wrapper makes the
 * plugin self-installing: it fetches dependencies once if they are missing,
 * then hands off to `mcp-start.mjs`, which builds from source and serves.
 *
 * Two hard constraints, inherited from mcp-start.mjs:
 *   1. stdout is the JSON-RPC transport. Every byte npm and tsc emit must be
 *      redirected to stderr or the stream is corrupted and the server looks
 *      broken to the client.
 *   2. Nothing here may hang forever. A first install compiling better-sqlite3
 *      from source can take a while; the client's startup timeout is the real
 *      limit, so we log progress to stderr and let the user see it.
 *
 * Once `@memoria/mcp` is published, `npx -y @memoria/mcp` becomes the simpler
 * command and this wrapper is only needed for a source install.
