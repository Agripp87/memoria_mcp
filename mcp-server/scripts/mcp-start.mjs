/**
 * MCP stdio entry point that builds before it serves.
 *
 * Why this exists: the MCP client used to launch `node dist/index.js` directly.
 * `dist/` is gitignored and nothing rebuilt it, so the globally registered
 * server silently ran a 2026-06-05 build for seven weeks — none of the July
 * remediation (PRs #23-#27) was live, and `memory_entities` wasn't even
 * registered. Pointing the launcher at an artifact that nothing produces
 * guarantees drift; this wrapper closes that gap.
 *
 * Two hard constraints:
 *   1. stdout is the JSON-RPC transport. `tsc` writes diagnostics to *stdout*,
 *      which would corrupt the stream, so compiler output is captured and
 *      re-emitted on stderr.
 *   2. A type error must not leave the user with no memory at all. If the build
 *      fails but a previous `dist/` exists, warn loudly and serve the stale
 *      build rather than exiting.
