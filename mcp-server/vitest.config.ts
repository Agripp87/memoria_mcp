      // every high-risk module after tools.test.ts + the phase 1-3 suites

      // 2026-09: RE-BASELINED for vitest 4, which is a different instrument,
      // not weaker tests. v4 makes AST-aware remapping the default, so it
      // counts real syntactic branches and functions instead of v8's coarse
      // ranges. Measured on identical source with the same 248 passing tests:
      //
      //             vitest 3              vitest 4
      //   branches  827/1128  = 73.31%    914/2142 = 42.67%
      //   functions 190/290   = 65.51%    280/489  = 57.25%
      //   stmts     4423/7539 = 58.66%    2133/3885 = 54.90%
      //
      // Absolute covered branches went UP (827 -> 914); the denominator nearly
      // doubled because v4 sees branches v3 never counted. The percentages
      // below are therefore re-derived against the new instrument using the
      // same "a few points under measured" policy. This is the one case where
      // lowering a number is not a relaxation -- do not treat it as licence to
      // lower them again. Against v4, ratcheting up still applies.
