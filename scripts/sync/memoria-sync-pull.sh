# Memoria sync: pull. Bring this device's memory store up to date with the
# shared remote. Intended for a Claude Code SessionStart hook, but it is a
# plain script — cron, a shell alias or a systemd timer work just as well.
#
# Requirements: the store ($MEMORIA_DIR, default ~/.memoria) is a git repo with
# a remote. Object storage is optional (see MEMORIA_SYNC_MIRROR below).
#
# Design notes, learned the hard way in the maintainer's own store:
#
#   * Unflushed local changes are COMMITTED before pulling, never used as a
#     reason to skip the pull. An earlier version skipped whenever the store
#     was dirty; that fired on one pull in three, so sessions routinely started
#     stale and then pushed the stale state back over newer files. Committing
#     first makes local work unlosable, so the pull is always safe to run.
#   * Daily logs are append-only, so a both-sides edit has a mechanical
#     resolution: keep both sides' lines. That is exactly git's built-in
#     `union` merge driver, enabled by the .gitattributes in store-template/.
#     Set it up once and same-day edits from two machines merge silently.
#   * Every step fails soft. A hook that blocks a session because the network
#     is down is worse than a stale memory.
#
# Environment:
#   MEMORIA_DIR           store root (default: ~/.memoria)
#   MEMORIA_SYNC_REMOTE   git remote name (default: origin)
#   MEMORIA_SYNC_BRANCH   branch (default: the store's current branch)
#   MEMORIA_SYNC_MIRROR   optional path to an executable that mirrors an object
#                         store; called as `<script> pull "$MEMORIA_DIR"` before
#                         the git merge. Default: $MEMORIA_DIR/.memoria-mirror.sh
#                         if it exists and is executable.
#   MEMORIA_SYNC_LOG      log file (default: $MEMORIA_DIR/.sync.log)
