# Memoria sync: push. Commit this session's memory changes and publish them.
# Intended for a Claude Code Stop hook (fires at the end of every assistant
# turn), so the common path has to be fast and quiet.
#
# See memoria-sync-pull.sh for the shared design notes. Same environment
# variables, plus:
#
#   MEMORIA_SYNC_INTERVAL_S  minimum seconds between pushes (default 900).
#                            The Stop hook fires constantly; without this the
#                            store would push on every turn. Local commits
#                            still happen every time — only the network round
#                            trip is rate-limited. Set 0 to push every time.
